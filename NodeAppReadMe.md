## Node App instructions 
1. Crate a new repository on github.com
2. On github.com click the copy clip board icon in green and go to your terminal. cd into which folder you want to clone the new repo in. 
3. type git clone and paste the link you copied from github.com 
4. Type in terminal npm init -y to make a package.json and the -y will automatically setup everything for you by default. 
5. touch an index.js if there isnt one. this will be the workspace you code on. 
6. go to website https://www.npmjs.com/ and type in the search what you are interested in. For this example typed in freestyle.
7. this is my example of what I found on this website https://www.npmjs.com/package/freestyle

9. what this npm does is it will make a random rap lyircs for you. 

10. scroll down on the page and find where it says install. You can install this in your terminal by typing npm i freestyle and it will download the package. Should show a bar loading up in the terminal to show its progress. 
11. theres an example the author put and you can follow it line by line to get it working. 
12. for this npm to work make sure to make a .txt file because he didnt mention to do one. and that where the words generate from to create random rap freestyle. He called his qwants.txt. 

13. after everything is all done go to terminal and touch .gitignore. 

14. Then click inside the .gitignore on the left hand page tab and add node_modules so the folder doesn't upload to github. This will hide it.

15. link to my repo.
